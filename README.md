## My Unique Modification to this Project 
-I added an additional button that reset the score back to zero
-The reason I did this was because the basic version of this from the videos, there was no reset button. 
Also in order to reset the score a developer or end user would have to quit out of the whole simulation and close the app in order to reset the score. 
-Instead of this I developed a function and a button to reset the score back to zero within the app. 
This is so the end user and developer can continue playing the app and reset the score when they want to start over. 
No need to close the app and miss out on the fun.
